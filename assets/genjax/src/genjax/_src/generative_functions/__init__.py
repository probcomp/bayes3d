"""This module contains several standard generative function classes useful for
structuring probabilistic programs.

* The `distributions` module exports standard distributions from several sources, including SciPy (`scipy`), TensorFlow Probability Distributions (`tfd`), and custom distributions.
    * The `distributions` module also contains a small `oryx`-like language called `coryx` which implements the generative function interface for programs with inverse log determinant Jacobian (ildj) compatible return value functions of distribution random choices.
    * The `distributions` module also contains an implementation of `gensp`, a research language for probabilistic programming with estimated densities.
* The `builtin` module contains a function-like language for defining generative functions from programs.
* The `combinators` module contains combinators which support transforming generative functions into new ones with structured control flow patterns of computation.
