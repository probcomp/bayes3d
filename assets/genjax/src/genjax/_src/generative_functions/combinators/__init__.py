"""The `combinators` module exposes _generative function combinators_,
generative functions which accept other generative functions as configuration
arguments, and implement structured patterns of control flow (as well as other
types of modifications) as their generative function interface implementations.

GenJAX features several standard combinators:

* `UnfoldCombinator` - which exposes a scan-like pattern for generative computation in a state space pattern via implementations utilizing `jax.lax.scan`.
* `MapCombinator` - which exposes generative vectorization over input arguments, whose implementation utilizes `jax.vmap`.
* `SwitchCombinator` - which exposes stochastic branching patterns utilizing `jax.lax.switch`.
