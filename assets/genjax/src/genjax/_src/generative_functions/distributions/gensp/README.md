# GenSP

This is a Python implementation (on top of JAX + GenJAX's Gen interfaces) of `GenSP` - a set of concepts and types for compositional programming with estimated densities. 

The original source code was developed by Alex Lew in Julia here: https://github.com/probcomp/GenSP.jl.

A formal description of elements of this work can be found in Alex Lew's work on [Recursive auxiliary-variable inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02836) (will update with a formal citation).
