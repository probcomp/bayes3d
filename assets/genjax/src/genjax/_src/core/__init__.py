"""This module provides the core functionality and JAX compatibility layer
which `GenJAX` generative function and inference modules are built on top of.
It contains (truncated, and in no particular order):

* Core data types for the associated data types of generative functions.

* Utility abstract data types (mixins) for automatically registering class definitions as valid `Pytree` method implementors (guaranteeing `flatten`/`unflatten` compatibility across JAX transform boundaries). For more information, see [Pytrees](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html).

* Transformation interpreters: interpreter-based transformations which operate on `ClosedJaxpr` instances, as well as staging functionality for staging out computations to `ClosedJaxpr` instances. The core interpreters are written in a mixed initial / final style. The application of all interpreters are JAX compatible, meaning that the application of any interpreter can be staged out to eliminate the interpreter overhead.
