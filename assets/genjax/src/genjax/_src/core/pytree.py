"""This module contains a utility class for defining new `jax.Pytree`
implementors.

In addition to this functionality, there's a "sum type" `Pytree`
implementation which allows effective decomposition of multiple

This allows, among other things, an efficient implementation of

        The implementation of `flatten` assumes the following contract:

        * must return a 2-tuple of tuples.
        * the first tuple is "dynamic" data - things that JAX tracers are allowed to population.
        * the second tuple is "static" data - things which are known at JAX tracing time. Static data is also used by JAX for `Pytree` equality comparison.

        For more information, consider [JAX's documentation on Pytrees](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html).

        Returns:

            dynamic: Dynamic data which supports JAX tracer values.
            static: Static data which is JAX trace time constant.

        Examples:

            Let's assume that you are implementing a new dataclass. Here's how you would define the dataclass using the `Pytree` mixin.

            ```python
            @dataclass
            class MyFoo(Pytree):
                static_field: Any
                dynamic_field: Any

                    return (self.dynamic_field, ), (self.static_field, )
            ```

            !!! info "Ordering fields in `Pytree` declarations"

                Note that the ordering in the dataclass declaration **does matter** - you should put static fields first. The automatically defined `unflatten` method (c.f. below) assumes this ordering.

            Now, given the declaration, you can use `jax.tree_util` flattening/unflatten functionality.
