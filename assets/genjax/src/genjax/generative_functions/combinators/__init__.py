"""This module holds a set of generative function implementations called
generative function combinators.

These combinators accept generative functions as arguments, and return
generative functions with modified choice map shapes and behavior.

They are used to express common patterns of computation, including
if-else (`SwitchCombinator`), mapping across vectorial arguments (`MapCombinator`), and dependent for-loops (`UnfoldCombinator`).

.. attention::

    The implementations of these combinators are similar to those in `Gen.jl`, but JAX imposes extra restrictions on their construction and usage.

    In contrast to `Gen.jl`, `UnfoldCombinator` must have the number of
    unfold steps specified ahead of time as a static constant. The length of the unfold chain cannot depend on a variable whose value is known
    only at runtime.

    Similarly, for `MapCombinator` - the shape of the vectorial arguments
    which will be mapped over must be known at JAX tracing time.

    These restrictions are not due to the implementation, but are fundamental to JAX's programming model (as it stands currently).
