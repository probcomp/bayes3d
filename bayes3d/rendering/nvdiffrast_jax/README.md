This is a JAX library developed for Bayes3D that provides high-performance primitive operations for rasterization-based differentiable rendering.

The CUDA/OpenGL(C++) primitive operations are adapted from [NvDiffrast](https://github.com/probcomp/bayes3d/tree/diff_renderer/bayes3d/rendering/nvdiffrast_jax).
The JAX custom operations are engineered based on the principles outlined in the official [JAX documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Custom_Operation_for_GPUs.html).
